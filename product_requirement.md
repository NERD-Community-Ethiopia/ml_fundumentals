### Problem Definition
**Problem**: Breast Cancer Diagnosis Classification  
**Description**: The goal is to classify breast tumors as either **malignant** (cancerous) or **benign** (non-cancerous) using features derived from medical imaging of breast tissue samples. This is a **binary classification problem**, where the task is to predict the tumor class based on numerical attributes describing cell characteristics.

**Objective**: Build a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to accurately distinguish between malignant and benign tumors using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset.

**Dataset**:  
- **Source**: Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+(Diagnostic))  
- **Size**: 569 instances (samples)  
- **Features**: 30 numerical attributes (e.g., mean radius, texture, perimeter, smoothness) computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast tissue.  
- **Target**: Binary label indicating tumor type (malignant or benign).

**Real-World Impact**: Accurate classification can assist medical professionals in early diagnosis, improving patient outcomes by identifying cancerous tumors for timely treatment.

### Model Input and Output
**Input (Features)**:  
The input to the SVM model consists of **30 numerical features** extracted from the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. These features describe characteristics of cell nuclei in the tumor sample, including:  
- **Mean features**: Radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, fractal dimension (10 features).  
- **Standard error**: Standard error of the above measurements (10 features).  
- **Worst (largest) values**: Largest values of the above measurements (10 features).  
Each sample (row) in the dataset is a vector of these 30 features, represented as \( X = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_{30}] \), where each \( x_i \) is a numerical value.

**Example Input**:  
A single sample might look like:  
\[ 17.99, 10.38, 122.80, 1001.0, 0.1184, 0.2776, ..., 0.006193 \]  
(30 values corresponding to the features listed above).

**Output (Target)**:  
The output of the SVM model is a **binary class label** indicating the tumor diagnosis:  
- **0**: Benign (non-cancerous)  
- **1**: Malignant (cancerous)  

**Model Task**: Given an input vector \( X \) with 30 features, the SVM predicts a single output \( y \), where \( y \in \{0, 1\} \).

**Example Output**:  
For the example input above, the model might predict:  
- \( y = 1 \) (malignant) or \( y = 0 \) (benign).

### Additional Notes
- **Data Preprocessing**: Features must be scaled (e.g., using StandardScaler) because SVM is sensitive to the scale of input features.  
- **SVM Model**: The model learns a hyperplane to separate the two classes in the feature space, potentially using a kernel (e.g., RBF or linear) to handle non-linear relationships.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix will be used to assess model performance.
