## ðŸŽ¯ **Level 1: Beginner (Your First Steps)**

### **Step 1: Set Up Your Environment (5 minutes)**

```bash
# 1. Navigate to the repository folder
cd workshop_session

# 2. Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Verify installation

```

### **Step 2: Understand What You're Building**

You're going to build a system that:
1. **Loads** breast cancer data
2. **Trains** 3 different AI models
3. **Compares** their performance
4. **Shows** which one is best

### **Step 3: Run Your First Pipeline (2 minutes)**

```bash
# Run the complete pipeline
python src/multi_model_pipeline.py
```

**What you should see:**
```
ðŸŽ“ TEACHING MODE: Running simple pipeline

Training XGBoost...
ðŸŽ‰ MULTI-MODEL AI COMPARISON PIPELINE COMPLETED!
```

### **Step 4: Explore Your Results (5 minutes)**

```bash
# View what was created
python demo_results.py
```

**Look for these files:**

## ðŸš€ **Level 2: Intermediate (Deep Dive)**

### **Step 1: Understand the Code Structure**

**Explore these key files:**

**`src/multi_model_pipeline.py`** - Main pipeline
```python
# Read the comments! They explain each step
def run_multi_model_training(config: dict):
    """This function trains multiple models"""
    # Step 1: Load data
    # Step 2: Train models
    # Step 3: Compare results
```

**`src/models/multi_model_trainer.py`** - How models are trained
```python
# Look at the _define_model_configs method
# This shows how different models are configured
```

**`configs/config.yaml`** - Configuration settings
```yaml
# Try changing these values:
training:
  test_size: 0.2  # How much data to use for testing
  random_state: 42  # For reproducible results
```

### **Step 2: Test the Model API**

```bash
# Test your trained models
python test_multi_model.py
```

**What this does:**
- Loads your trained models
- Makes predictions on sample data
- Shows how different models predict

### **Step 3: Explore the Visualizations**

**Open these files:**
- `models/checkpoints/model_accuracy_comparison.png`
- `models/checkpoints/model_auc_comparison.png`
- `models/checkpoints/model_performance_comparison.png`

**What to look for:**
- Which model has the highest accuracy?
- Which model has the highest AUC?
- Are the results consistent?

### **Step 4: Understand Model Evaluation**

**Key Metrics:**
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions
- **AUC**: Area Under Curve (better for imbalanced data)
- **Cross-Validation**: Average performance across multiple tests

**Read the comparison report:**
```bash
# Look at the detailed results
cat models/checkpoints/model_comparison_report_*.yaml
```

### **Step 5: Experiment with Parameters**

**Try changing model parameters:**

1. **Edit `configs/config.yaml`:**
```yaml
# Change the number of trees in Random Forest
# Find the multi_model_trainer.py file and look for n_estimators
```

2. **Run the pipeline again:**
```bash
python src/multi_model_pipeline.py
```

3. **Compare results:**
- Did the performance change?
- Which parameters matter most?

## ðŸ”¬ **Level 3: Advanced (MLOps & Production)**

### **Step 1: Enable Experiment Tracking**

**Edit `configs/config.yaml`:**
```yaml
experiment:
  use_experiment_tracking: true  # Change this to true
```

**Run with experiment tracking:**
```bash
python src/multi_model_pipeline.py
```

**What this adds:**
- MLflow experiment tracking
- Model versioning
- Performance history

### **Step 2: Use the Interactive Pipeline**

```bash
python run_pipeline.py
```

**Choose your mode:**
- **Teaching Mode**: Simple, no experiment tracking
- **Advanced Mode**: Full MLOps features

### **Step 3: Start the API Server**

```bash
# Start the model serving API
python -m uvicorn src.models.multi_model_serving:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Test the API:**
```bash
# In another terminal
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/models
```

### **Step 4: Deploy Full Production Stack**

**Deploy complete production environment:**
```bash
# Deploy all production services
./deploy_production.sh

# Access production services:
# - API Documentation: http://localhost/api/docs
# - MLflow Experiment Tracking: http://localhost/mlflow
# - Grafana Dashboards: http://localhost:3000
# - Prometheus Monitoring: http://localhost:9090
```

- **Database persistence** with PostgreSQL
- **Caching** with Redis
- **Load balancing** with Nginx

- **Security** with rate limiting and SSL-ready config

### **Step 5: Explore Advanced Components**

**Study these files:**

**`src/utils/experiment_tracker.py`** - MLflow integration
```python
# This shows how to track experiments professionally
class ExperimentTracker:
    def log_parameters(self, params):
        # Logs model parameters
    def log_metrics(self, metrics):
        # Logs performance metrics
```

**`src/visualization/`** - Professional plotting
```python
# Advanced visualization functions
from visualization.model_comparison import create_model_comparison_plots
```

**`docker-compose.yml`** - Production orchestration
```yaml
# Complete production stack
services:
  ml-app:          # Your ML application
  mlflow:          # Experiment tracking
  postgres:        # Database
